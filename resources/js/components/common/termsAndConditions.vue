                      professional to assist with increasing sales in their Product, creates an
                      account on the Platform (Account) and then creates a post setting out
                      details of their Product and the services they require (Product Owner
                      Listing). Product Owners may also then browse and view any Sales Person
                      Profiles.
                      A Sales Person, seeking to provide their services to a Product Owner, also
                      creates an Account and a profile which sets out an accurate, complete and up
                      to date description of their services, skills, qualifications and experience
                      (Sales Person Profile). A Sales Person may then browse the current Product
                      Owner Listings.
                      A Sales Person may submit a proposal to the Product Owner in response to the
                      Product Owner Listing through the Platform, setting out what the Sales
                      Person can do for the Product Owner. A Product Owner may request the
                      services of the Sales Person as set out in the Sales Person Listing, by
                      sending a request through the Platform (each a Proposal). By Submitting a
                      Proposal, each party warrants and represents that they are legally entitled
                      to enter into that relationship.
                      Where a party accepts a Proposal submitted by the other Party, an engagement
                      is created on the terms and conditions set out in the Proposal (or as
                      otherwise subsequently agreed between the Parties). (Engagement).
                      A Proposal should set out the key details of a proposed Engagement,
                      including but not limited to, the terms and conditions for the Engagement
                      and the commission payable to the Sales Person or the commission offered by
                      the Product Owner (Commission).
                      Upon an Engagement being created, the Product Owner and Sales Person may
                      enter into their own written agreements in relation to the Engagement,
                      setting out the terms, conditions and expectations in relation to the
                      Engagement (Engagement Agreement). Where there the parties do not implement
                      an Engagement Agreement, the Engagement will be conducted on the terms and
                      conditions set out in the Proposal.
                      You are solely responsible for the terms and implementation of the
                      Engagement Agreement or Proposal and we accept no responsibility or
                      liability in relation to the Engagement Agreement or Proposal. To the extent
                      there is an inconsistency between the Engagement Agreement or Proposal, or
                      any other additional terms and conditions, and these Terms, these Terms will
                      prevail.

                      The cancellation of an Engagement organised through the
                      Platform, or refund of Commissions paid in respect of any services provided
                      by a Sales Professional is strictly a matter between the relevant Product
                      Owner and Sales Person. The terms and conditions for cancellations or
                      refunds in respect of an Engagement should be agreed between the Sales
                      Person and the Product Owner and clearly set out in the relevant Proposal or
                      Engagement Agreement, subject to the following clauses:

                        <li>
                          A Product Owner and Sales Person can mutually agree to cancel an

                          order to fulfil their obligations under the Engagement and those attempts
                          are unsuccessful or unanswered, the Engagement may be deemed cancelled.
                          For disputes between a Product Owner and Sales Person, we encourage Parties
                          to attempt to resolve disputes (including claims for returns or refunds)
                          with the other Party directly and in good faith, either on the Platform or
                          through external communication methods. In the event that a dispute cannot
                          be resolved through these means, the Parties may choose to resolve the
                          dispute in any manner agreed between the Parties or otherwise in accordance
                          with applicable laws.

                      You agree to provide true, fair and accurate information in your Review. If
                      we consider that the Review is untrue, unfair, inaccurate, offensive or

                      correspondence (collectively referred to as a Product Owner Experience).
                      You can write a Review about a Product Owner if you have had an experience
                      with that Product Owner, which means that (1) you have been engaged by the
                      Product Owner through the Platform; or (2) you can otherwise document your

                      or Engagement initiated through the Platform. Your Product Owner Experience
                      or Sales Person Experience must have occurred in the 12 months prior to you

                      You are encouraged to be specific and factual in your Reviews. If you have
                      been offered an incentive by a Sales Person to write a Review, you should

                      Subject to your Statutory Rights, we exclude all express and implied
                      warranties, and all material, work and services (including the Platform) are

                      As a Product Owner, the services provided by a Sales Person may also confer
